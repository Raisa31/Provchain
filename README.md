## Description:

In this project, we develop a provenance knowledge framework and demonstrate how its application can enhance assurances and reduce perceived risks via the application of blockchain. The goal is to implement a supply chain based on blockchain with NFC tags, which incur minimum cost of implementation. 

This method provides the same level of security as other methods which are less cost efficient.

## Getting Started


### Prerequisites

Operating System: Windows10, Ubuntu 16.0.4

Tools:

1. Ganache
2. Metamask


### QuickStart

Open Ganache desktop application and import the test accounts for each participant to Metamask. 

Enter the Truffle project Directory

```
cd Truffle Project
```

Download Node Libraries

```
npm install
```

Compile the Ethereum contracts

```
truffle compile
```

Migrate all contracts to the local Ethereum network in Ganache by entering the following in the terminal:

```
truffle migrate --reset
```

After the contracts have been compiled and migrated, run npm server to run frontend dApp:

```
npm run dev
```

The website is now running on localhost:3000
